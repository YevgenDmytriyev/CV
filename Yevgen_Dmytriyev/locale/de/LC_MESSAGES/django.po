"\n"
"            Our service provides a fast and efficient way to shorten URLs. "
"Here's how it works:\n"
"\n"
"            - **URL Shortening**: Submit your long URL and receive a "
"shortened version. This makes sharing easier and more efficient.\n"
"\n"
"            - **Advertisement Interstitial**: Optionally, the shortened URL "
"can redirect through an advertisement page, displaying ads for a few seconds "
"before reaching the original URL. This model supports our service and offers "
"benefits to users who opt-in.\n"
"\n"
"            - **Skip Ads Option**: For a small fee, users can choose to "
"bypass the advertisement interstitial, directly reaching their destination "
"URL without any delay.\n"
"\n"
"            - **Benefits of Using Our Service**: Besides shortening URLs, "
"our service offers tracking capabilities, allowing you to see the number of "
"clicks and other relevant metrics. This is invaluable for marketing and "
"tracking the effectiveness of your links.\n"
"\n"
"            We are committed to providing a valuable service that enhances "
"your online experience, whether through efficient URL management or optional "
"advertisement viewing for additional benefits.\n"
